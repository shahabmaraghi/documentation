# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide walks you through installing dependencies, running the docs locally, and understanding the project structure.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or newer (matches the Nextra 4 requirements)
- npm 9+ or an alternative package manager such as pnpm or Yarn
- Git access so you can clone and pull updates

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If you prefer pnpm or Yarn, remove the `package-lock.json` first to avoid mixed lockfiles.

## Start the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the docs. The sidebar navigation mirrors the structure defined in `_meta.json`.

## Next steps
