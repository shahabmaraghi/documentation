# Deployment Workflow

Once your project runs locally, follow these steps to share it with your team and users.

## Prepare the build

1. Ensure the latest dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the production build to surface any issues:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the preview server and smoke test the critical paths:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Continuous deployment

- Connect the repository to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, or your internal platform).
- Configure environment variables in the provider dashboard. Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables public, the rest private.
- Enable automatic deployments from your main or release branch. Protect the branch with reviews to keep docs accurate.

## Release checklist

- [ ] Update the changelog in `reference/release-notes.mdx`.
- [ ] Announce breaking changes in the community forum.
- [ ] Verify the sidebar navigation and search index after each deploy.

Sticking to the checklist keeps your documentation site reliable and trustworthy.
