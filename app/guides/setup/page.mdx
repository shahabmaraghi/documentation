# Local Setup

Configure your environment to match the project standards. Completing these steps keeps onboarding smooth for every contributor.

## 1. Install recommended extensions

- **ESLint** – surfaces lint issues inline.
- **Prettier** – ensures consistent formatting.
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** – auto-complete for utility classes.

## 2. Configure environment variables

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Update the file with the API keys you were given. Never commit secrets—`.env.local` is already ignored.

## 3. Run lint and tests

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

Fix any issues before opening a pull request. Keeping the docs site green prevents broken deployments.

## 4. Enable auto-formatting

In VS Code, add the following workspace settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```
